Protocol
========

All messages (except handshaking) begin with an integer, meaning client ID.


Handshaking
===========

Client                       Server
         --->
    "CONN %s" % name


         <---
     "%d ACK" % ID

OR

         <---
        "NACK %s" % optional_message


obviously ACK means accept.
ID is an integer for the client to identify itself and others with.
